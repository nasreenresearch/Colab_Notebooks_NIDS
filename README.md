# üß† Colab_Notebooks_NIDS  
**AI-Driven Network Intrusion Detection, XAI, and Adversarial Security Framework**

This repository provides a unified set of **Google Colab notebooks** for research and experimentation on **Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)**.  
It integrates **malware and intrusion detection datasets**, **deep learning architectures**, **Explainable AI (XAI)**, and **Adversarial AI** modules to advance intelligent, interpretable, and resilient cybersecurity analytics.

## üîç Overview
`Colab_Notebooks_NIDS` supports full-stack IDS experimentation, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, adversarial testing, and explainability visualization.  
It was developed as part of the research thesis *‚ÄúResilient AI-Driven Network Intrusion Detection System for Emerging Threats‚Äù* (Deakin University & VIT Chennai, 2025).

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Open any notebook in **Google Colab** or local Jupyter.  
2. Mount or upload dataset files (instructions inside each notebook).  
3. Run cells sequentially to train models, visualize results, and test robustness.  
4. Use provided functions for incremental learning and XAI analysis.  

```python
# Example: Training a CNN model on CIC-IDS-2018
from models.cnn import train_cnn
from utils.data_loader import load_cicids2018

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_cicids2018()
model = train_cnn(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64)

# Example: Running SHAP explainability
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(model, X_test[:100])
shap_values = explainer(X_test[:100])
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
